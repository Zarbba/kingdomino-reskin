# Space Domino

## Choice of Game: Kingdomino
For this project I chose to attempt to implement the board game [Kingdomino](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/204583/kingdomino). I chose this because I wanted to attempt something ambitious and because I own the game and play it regularly I felt I could draw on my familiarity with the rules.
> Kingdomino won the prestigious Spiel des Jahres in 2017!

## Getting Started
You can find a deployed version of the game [here](https://zarbba.github.io/kingdomino-reskin/). A brief description of the game rules can be found on the deployed page. Those with interest may wish to see the original [rules](https://boardgamegeek.com/filepage/136291/kingdomino-english-rules).
